# Monolith to Micro Project

Please see the screenshots in the screenshots directory

The link to the project rubric is not working, so I am submitting based on requirements mentioned on other pages.

The screenshots show a successful build in Travis CI with a push to my dockerhub repositories:

https://hub.docker.com/r/mzucc/udacity-frontend/tags
https://hub.docker.com/r/mzucc/udacity-restapi-feed/tags
https://hub.docker.com/r/mzucc/udacity-restapi-user/tags
https://hub.docker.com/r/mzucc/reverseproxy/tags

My github repo is here:

https://github.com/mzucchelli/monotomicro

The env-configmap.yaml, env-secret.yaml, and aws-secret.yaml files are in their original form because I did not want to submit passwords to github.  I created my own copies with the credentials for deployment.

Thanks!
